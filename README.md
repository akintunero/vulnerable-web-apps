## Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Git CLI

💡 If you're new to Docker, refer to [Docker Getting Started Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

---

### 🐳 Docker Setup (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akintunero/vulnerable-web-apps.git
cd vulnerable-web-apps/ConfusedCloud   # Replace with desired project

docker-compose up -d
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5000` (or as specified).

---

### Manual Setup (Python)

> **⚠️ WARNING:**  
> Running this application in manual (Python) mode is NOT recommended.  
> This may expose your computer to vulnerabilities and could allow the app to escape to the internet.  
> **Always use Docker for safe, isolated testing.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akintunero/vulnerable-web-apps.git
cd vulnerable-web-apps/ConfusedCloud   # Replace with desired project

pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

---

## Usage

Each project can be run independently using the provided `start.sh` scripts:

```bash
# ConfusedCloud
cd ConfusedCloud
./start.sh
# Access at http://localhost:8001

# CyberMart
cd CyberMart
./start.sh
# Access at http://localhost:5002

# FakeCrypto
cd FakeCrypto
./start.sh
# Access at http://localhost:7004

# EnterpriseHR
cd EnterpriseHR
./start.sh
# Access at http://localhost:8000

# SkyHack
cd SkyHack
./start.sh
# Access at http://localhost:8080

# VoteVault
cd VoteVault
./start.sh
# Access at http://localhost:5003
```

**Alternative Methods:**
- Use `docker-compose up -d` directly in each project directory
- CyberMart also has `./run.sh` for advanced management features
