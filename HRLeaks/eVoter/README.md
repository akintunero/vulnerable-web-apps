docker-compose up --build
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.

## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/akintunero/evoting-system.git
cd evoting-system

# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Access the application
open http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 2: Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/akintunero/evoting-system.git
cd evoting-system

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

## üéÆ Usage



### Basic Workflow
1. **Register/Login** - Create an account
2. **View Candidates** - Learn about each candidate's policies
3. **Cast Vote** - Select your preferred candidate and confirm
4. **View Results** - Monitor live election results
5. **Export Data** - Download results in various formats

### Key Pages
- **Home** (`/`) - Landing page with election timer
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Main voting interface
- **Candidates** (`/candidates`) - Candidate profiles and policies
- **Results** (`/results`) - Live election results
- **FAQ** (`/faq`) - Frequently asked questions

## üìö API Documentation

### Core Endpoints
- `GET /` - Home page
- `GET /dashboard` - Voting dashboard
