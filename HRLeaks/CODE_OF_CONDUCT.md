# Code of Conduct

## ü§ù **Our Pledge**

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## üéØ **Our Standards**

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## üîí **Security and Educational Responsibility**

### Special Considerations for HRLeaks

As a deliberately vulnerable application designed for educational purposes, we have additional responsibilities:

#### ‚úÖ **Appropriate Use**
* Using the application only in controlled, isolated environments
* Respecting the educational purpose of the vulnerabilities
* Following responsible disclosure practices
* Contributing to the security education community

#### ‚ùå **Inappropriate Use**
* Attempting to use vulnerabilities against real systems
* Sharing exploits without proper context
* Using the application for malicious purposes
* Attempting to access systems beyond the intended scope

## üõ†Ô∏è **Enforcement Responsibilities**

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## üìã **Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Enforcement**

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
akintunero101@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## üìè **Enforcement Guidelines**

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. **Correction**
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. **Warning**
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. **Temporary Ban**
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. **Permanent Ban**
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## üìû **Reporting Guidelines**

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report
it by emailing akintunero101@gmail.com. For more urgent situations that require
immediate attention, please use the subject line `[URGENT] Code of Conduct Violation`.

### What to Include in Your Report
* Your contact information (so we can get in touch with you if we need to
  follow up)
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Description of what happened
* Description of the context around the situation
* Any relevant links (e.g., to GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussions)

### What Happens After You Report
You will receive an email from the community leaders acknowledging receipt
within 24 hours (and will aim to respond much sooner than that). The community
leaders will immediately meet to review the incident and determine:
* What happened
* Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
* Who the bad actor was
* Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's
  physical safety

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety,
the working group's immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved.
This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the
situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the working group has a complete account of the events, they will make a
decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:
* Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred)
* A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved
* A public reprimand
* An imposed vacation (i.e., asking someone to "take a week off" from a
  mailing list or IRC)
* A temporary or permanent ban from some or all HRLeaks spaces (GitHub
  repositories, IRC channels, etc.)
* A request for a public apology

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a
resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to
let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account
feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we
don't guarantee we'll act on it.

## üîÑ **Appealing**

Only permanent resolutions (such as permanent bans) may be appealed. To appeal
a decision of the working group, contact the community leaders at
akintunero101@gmail.com with your appeal and the community leaders will
reconsider the case.
