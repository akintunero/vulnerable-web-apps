# Security Policy

## 🔒 **Security Policy for HRLeaks**

### ⚠️ **Important Notice**

**HRLeaks is intentionally vulnerable and designed for educational purposes only. This application contains multiple deliberate security vulnerabilities and should NEVER be deployed in production environments or on public networks.**

## 🎯 **Purpose**

This security policy outlines:
- How to report security issues
- Our commitment to responsible disclosure
- Guidelines for using this vulnerable application
- Contact information for security concerns

## 🚨 **Reporting Security Issues**

### For Real Security Issues (Not Intentional Vulnerabilities)

If you discover a security issue that is **NOT** an intentional vulnerability in HRLeaks, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO** email us at: akintunero101@gmail.com
3. **Include** detailed information about the issue
4. **Provide** steps to reproduce the problem
5. **Specify** your environment and setup

### What to Report

**Report these types of issues:**
- Unintended security vulnerabilities
- Data leakage beyond intended scope
- Container escape vulnerabilities
- Network security issues
- Authentication bypasses (beyond intended ones)

**Do NOT report:**
- Intentional vulnerabilities (these are documented)
- Issues in mock/test data
- Expected behavior of vulnerable features

## 📋 **Responsible Disclosure Timeline**

We are committed to addressing legitimate security issues promptly:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available

## 🛡️ **Safe Usage Guidelines**

### ✅ **Safe Environments**
- Isolated virtual machines
- Docker containers in isolated networks
- Offline testing environments
- Controlled lab environments
- Educational institutions (with proper controls)

### ❌ **Unsafe Environments**
- Production servers
- Public cloud instances
- Internet-facing deployments
- Shared hosting environments
- Networks with sensitive data

## 🔧 **Security Best Practices for Users**

### Environment Isolation
```bash
# Use isolated Docker networks
docker network create hrleaks-isolated

# Run with limited privileges
docker run --network hrleaks-isolated --read-only
```

### Network Security
- Disable external network access
- Use firewall rules to restrict access
- Monitor network traffic
- Log all access attempts

### Data Protection
- Use disposable test data only
- Never use real personal information
- Clear data after testing
- Use encrypted storage if needed

## 📊 **Vulnerability Management**

### Intentional Vulnerabilities
- All intentional vulnerabilities are documented
- Each vulnerability has educational value
- Vulnerabilities are contained within the application
- No external system access is possible

### Vulnerability Categories
1. **Web Application Vulnerabilities**
   - XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF
   - File upload vulnerabilities
   - Authentication bypasses

2. **System Vulnerabilities**
   - Command injection
   - Path traversal
   - Insecure deserialization

3. **Configuration Vulnerabilities**
   - Information disclosure
   - Weak authentication
   - Insecure defaults

## 🧪 **Testing Guidelines**

### Authorized Testing
- Test only in controlled environments
- Use provided test credentials
- Follow responsible disclosure if finding real issues
- Document your testing methodology

### Prohibited Activities
- Testing against production systems
- Attempting to access external systems
- Using real personal data
- Sharing vulnerabilities publicly before disclosure
